# TT Backend Progress Report: C3, D1, D2 Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Scope:** Implementation of passes C3, D1, and D2 following v5 specification
**Status:** ✅ **All three passes successfully implemented**

---

## Executive Summary

We have successfully implemented three critical passes that establish the foundation for the Tenstorrent backend's 3-kernel architecture:

1. **C3: BuildTileDFGTT** - Builds dataflow graph from protocol-less IR
2. **D1: SplitDeviceKernel** - Splits monolithic kernel into reader/compute/writer
3. **D2: ConfigureTensorAccessorTT** - Binds tensor accessors to runtime arguments

These passes represent a **major milestone**: the transition from monolithic kernels to the distributed 3-kernel architecture that is fundamental to Tenstorrent's execution model.

---

## Pass Implementation Details

### C3: BuildTileDFGTT ✅
**Location:** `/tilelang/tenstorrent/passes/build_tile_dfg_tt.py`

#### Purpose
Builds a tile-based dataflow graph from the protocol-less IR to enable intelligent kernel splitting.

#### Key Features
- **Node Types**: Buffer, CB, Compute, Read, Write operations
- **Edge Types**: Data flow relationships (read, write, compute input/output)
- **Role Assignment**: Preliminary assignment of operations to kernels
- **CB Management**: Tracks CB allocations and suggests index assignments (0-31)
- **Reuse Analysis**: Identifies CB reuse patterns for optimization

#### Output Metadata
```python
tt.tile_dfg = {
    "nodes": {...},           # All dataflow nodes
    "edges": [...],          # Producer-consumer relationships
    "kernel_roles": {...},   # Node-to-kernel mapping
    "cb_allocations": {...}, # CB specifications
    "cb_reuse": {...},      # Reuse patterns
    "stats": {...}          # Graph statistics
}
```

#### Design Decisions
- Uses visitor pattern to traverse TIR and extract dataflow
- Maintains separation between data movement and compute operations
- Prepares comprehensive metadata for D1's splitting logic

---

### D1: SplitDeviceKernel ✅
**Location:** `/tilelang/tenstorrent/passes/split_device_kernel.py`

#### Purpose
The **critical transformation** that splits monolithic kernels into the 3-kernel architecture.

#### Key Features
- **Kernel Splitting**: Creates separate reader, compute, and writer PrimFuncs
- **Statement Filtering**: Distributes TIR statements based on role
- **Buffer Management**: Assigns appropriate buffers to each kernel
- **CB Assignment**: Distributes CB indices across kernels (max 32 per kernel)
- **Runtime Args**: Sets up kernel-specific runtime arguments

#### Transformation Example
```python
# Input: Monolithic kernel
def gemm(A, B, C):
    alloc_cb(...)
    read_to_cb(A, cb_in0)
    read_to_cb(B, cb_in1)
    mm.mma(cb_in0, cb_in1)
    write_from_cb(cb_out, C)

# Output: Three kernels
def gemm_reader(A, B):
    read_to_cb(A, cb_in0)
    read_to_cb(B, cb_in1)

def gemm_compute():
    mm.mma(cb_in0, cb_in1)

def gemm_writer(C):
    write_from_cb(cb_out, C)
```

#### Runtime Arguments
- **Reader**: `[A_addr, B_addr, start_id, count, Mt, Kt, Nt]`
- **Compute**: `[Kt]` (iteration counts)
- **Writer**: `[C_addr, start_id, count, Mt, Nt]`

#### Design Decisions
- Preserves original function attributes across split
- Uses dataflow graph from C3 to guide splitting
- Maintains CB coherence across kernel boundaries

---

### D2: ConfigureTensorAccessorTT ✅
**Location:** `/tilelang/tenstorrent/passes/configure_tensor_accessor_tt.py`

#### Purpose
Binds abstract tensor accessors (from A3) to concrete runtime arguments after kernel splitting.

#### Key Features
- **Accessor Binding**: Links accessors to runtime argument indices
- **Type Conversion**: Changes accessor type from "abstract" to "bound"
- **Index Mapping**: Maps buffer addresses to argument slots
- **Dimension Binding**: Links Mt, Nt, Kt arguments for address calculation
- **Role-aware**: Different binding strategies for reader vs writer kernels

#### Binding Example
```python
# Before (abstract accessor)
{
    "type": "abstract",
    "buffer_name": "A",
    "runtime_arg_idx": None,
    "base_offset": None
}

# After (bound accessor)
{
    "type": "bound",
    "buffer_name": "A",
    "runtime_arg_idx": 0,      # A_addr is arg[0]
    "base_offset": 0,
    "start_id_idx": 2,         # start_id is arg[2]
    "Mt_idx": 4,               # Mt is arg[4]
    "binding_complete": True
}
```

#### Design Decisions
- Maintains separation between compile-time metadata and runtime binding
- Provides complete information for codegen to emit accessor calls
- Supports both global and shard-local addressing modes

## Integration and Dependencies

### Pass Dependencies
```
A1-A3 (Metadata) → B1-B2 (Partitioning) → C1-C3 (Protocol-less) → D1-D2 (Split & Bind)
                                                                         ↓
                                                              D3-D5 (Protocol insertion)
```

### Data Flow Through Passes
1. **A3** creates abstract tensor accessors
2. **C3** builds dataflow graph showing CB and buffer relationships
3. **D1** uses graph to split into 3 kernels with appropriate statements
4. **D2** binds accessors to runtime args in split kernels

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Created
- Each pass has standalone test with example IR
- Tests verify correct metadata generation
- Tests confirm proper kernel splitting

### Integration Points Verified
- C3 correctly analyzes protocol-less IR from C1/C2
- D1 successfully uses dataflow graph from C3
- D2 properly binds accessors in split kernels

### Test Coverage
- Basic GEMM pattern
- Element-wise operations
- Mixed CB allocation scenarios
- Various buffer access patterns

---

## Current Pipeline Status

### Complete ✅
- **Stage A (Metadata)**: 3/3 passes - 100%
- **Stage B (Partitioning)**: 2/2 passes - 100%
- **Stage C (Protocol-less)**: 3/3 passes - 100%
- **Stage D (Late Split)**: 2/5 passes - 40%

### Overall Progress
**11 of 17 passes complete = 65% of pipeline implemented**

### Critical Milestone Achieved
✅ **3-Kernel Architecture Established**: With D1 complete, we now have the fundamental transformation that splits monolithic kernels into the reader/compute/writer pattern required by Tenstorrent hardware.

---

## Next Critical Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Protocol Insertion)
1. **D3: LowerCBIntrinsics**
   - Insert NOC/CB protocol calls in reader/writer
   - Add cb_reserve_back, cb_push_back, noc_async_*, etc.

2. **D5: InsertDSTManagementTT**
   - Add DST lifecycle management to compute kernel
   - Insert acquire/commit/wait/release protocol

3. **D4: InsertComputeInitTT**
   - Add engine initialization to compute kernel
   - Insert binary_op_init_common, mm_init, etc.

### Why These Matter
The protocol insertion passes (D3-D5) are essential to make the split kernels actually executable on Tenstorrent hardware. Without them, we have the correct structure but missing the device-specific protocols.

---

## Technical Insights

### Progressive Lowering Success
The v5 progressive lowering design is proving highly effective:
- Early passes attach metadata without modifying IR structure
- Mid-level passes maintain protocol-less operations for analysis
- Late passes insert protocols only after structure is finalized

### 3-Kernel Architecture Benefits
Splitting into reader/compute/writer provides:
- **Overlap**: Data movement and computation can overlap
- **Specialization**: Each kernel optimized for its role
- **Scalability**: Clean mapping to Tenstorrent's RISC-V cores

### Metadata-Driven Design
Rich metadata (layouts, accessors, dataflow graphs) enables:
- Intelligent splitting decisions
- Correct protocol insertion
- Efficient runtime argument binding

---

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Dataflow Graph Extraction
**Problem**: Extracting clean dataflow from nested TIR structures
**Solution**: Visitor pattern with role-based filtering

### Challenge 2: Kernel Splitting Logic
**Problem**: Determining which statements belong to which kernel
**Solution**: Use dataflow graph roles and operation types

### Challenge 3: Accessor Binding
**Problem**: Mapping abstract accessors to runtime args
**Solution**: Role-aware binding with argument index maps
