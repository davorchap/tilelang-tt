## Archived Documents

### TT_Pass_Status.md
- **Original Location:** `docs/tenstorrent/planning/`
- **Version:** 3.0
- **Date Created:** 2025-10-15
- **Last Updated:** 2025-10-16
- **Why Archived:**
  - v5 pipeline is complete and deployed as default (PR #135)
  - Document served its purpose as implementation tracker
  - Now preserved as historical reference showing the v5 development process
  - Current pipeline status is maintained in production documentation

## Historical Significance

This document captures the complete implementation journey of the v5 pipeline:
- Tracks all 14 passes from conception to completion
- Shows the evolution from old pipeline to v5
- Documents the Python-only architecture decision
- Provides implementation timeline and test results

### Key Milestones Captured
- **2025-10-15**: Initial v5 pass implementations (A1, A2, B1)
- **2025-10-15**: Complete implementation of all 14 v5 passes
- **2025-10-16**: v5 pipeline deployed as default
- **2025-10-16**: Old pipeline removed

### Final Status Achieved
- 14 of 14 core passes complete âœ…
- 120 tests passing, 21 skipped (85.1% pass rate)
- Python-only implementation
- Full documentation in `v5_pipeline.md`

## For Current Information

For up-to-date pipeline documentation, please refer to:
- `docs/tenstorrent/architecture/v5_pipeline.md` - Complete v5 pipeline documentation
- `docs/tenstorrent/reference/PASS_TABLE_v5.md` - v5 pass reference table
- `tilelang/tenstorrent/passes/` - Actual pass implementations

## Note on Document Preservation

This document is preserved to show:
1. How the v5 pipeline was systematically implemented
2. The decision process for Python-only architecture
3. The testing and validation approach
4. The successful completion of the project

It serves as a valuable reference for understanding the project's development history and can inform future enhancement efforts.
